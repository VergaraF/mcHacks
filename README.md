Hackathon at McGill University.

SMSMe (the name of the app) is an application developed by Fabian Vergara, Steven Tucci and Johnny Mak which its goal is to give conectivity to people who have none. Many people don't have access to data, nor internet connection. It happens in Canada and first world countries, and it is even more present in third world countries. We are giving free access to information, locations and services to everyone who is able to have a phone in their hands, no matter if it is an expensive iPhone or a Nokia 1100. 

Anyone can chat with our bot using SMS, and the bot will be able to retrieve information asked by the user. In the future, we intend to make our BOT smarter by not using commands but texting him as you would text someone. The goal is to implement an intelligent bot who is capable to have a conversation (voice or text) with someone regardless their internet connection and device they are texting/calling from.
